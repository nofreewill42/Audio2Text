 The online decoder is copying CTC beam decoder interface, but it requires states and is_eos_s sequences. States are used to accumulate sequences of chunks, each corresponding to one data source. is_eos_s tells the decoder whether the chunks have stopped being pushed to the corresponding state. More examples, get the top beam for the first item in your batch, get the top 50 beams for the first item in your batch. Note, these will be a list of ints that need decoding. You likely already have a function to decode from int to text. But if not, you can do something like blaa-bla-blaaa, using the labels you passed into CTC beam decoder.
