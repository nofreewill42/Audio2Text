 This one will be just for to test how well this thing works. Yes, so the microphone is now working and now I want to test if this is really recognizing my words that I am saying or is there anything funny going on. If not, then I think I am happy with the results. So this will be the... we will see, yes. Maybe I will have to talk more clearly. That's another thing to think about. I don't know how much time it's already grabbed. I will just talk for another few minutes. Maybe I should go to these puzzles so that I can just think out loud. Yes, that's a good idea. So, there is a threat to that pawn. The knight is pinned. I can go to give a check. I can sacrifice the rook. Or I can go give a check like that. But no, because the queen will be there. After that I can take their knight. So that's an idea. But I am not really sure what to do now. By the way, I can even stop this recording and give this as an example for the speech-to-text model. If I say this another time, then maybe it will know better. Because this is like prompt engineering. So if I am speaking and I want this to be transcribed, and I am starting to talk about speech recognition, then slowly it will get better at recognizing the words it has to use. And speech recognition is the task of having an audio and if there is speech in it, then recognizing it. And writing down the words that are present in that audio. So now I will stop this and we will see how it performs.
